I have authored a number of R packages, that can all be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/MatthewSmith430)  

The key packages are:

- ITNr

- CompaniesHouse  

- GtR  

- GVTr  



## ITNr

This package provides a set of function to clean and process international trade data into a network.

It also provides tools to implement various descriptive analysis and plots of the international trade network.  

This package is also available on CRAN.

## CompaniesHouse

This package scrapes company data from Companies House, which provides information on UK companies. 

The package has additional function to process this data into a network of interlocking directors, and includes a number of functions to plot and analyse this network. 

A tutorial of how to use this package can be found [here](https://matthewsmith430.github.io/CompaniesHouse/index.html)

## GtR 

This is a package that searches and extracts data on UK Research Council funded projects from [Gateway to Research (GtR)](https://gtr.ukri.org/)  

A core aim of the package is to produce collaboration networks (at the individual and organisational level) that emerge from collaborative arrangements on these UK research council funded projects.  

Further detail on the package, including functions available and the type of information it extracts from Gateway to Research can be found [here](https://matthewsmith430.github.io/GtR/)  


## GVTr

This package allows to extract and analyse world input out data, extracting Global Value Trees as outlined by:

Zhu Z, Puliga M, Cerina F, Chessa A, Riccaboni M (2015) Global Value Trees. PLoS ONE 10(5): e0126699. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126699>

The package contain the wiod data for 2000 -2014, allows to create value added networks from this data, prune into global value trees and visualise these GVTs.
