I have authored a number of R packages, that can all be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/MatthewSmith430)  

The key packages are:

- ITNr

- CompaniesHouse  

- GVTr  


## ITNr

This package provides a set of function to clean and process international trade data into a network.

It also provides tools to implement various descriptive analysis and plots of the international trade network.

## CompaniesHouse

This package scrapes company data from Companies House, which provides information on UK companies. 

The package has additional function to process this data into a network of interlocking directors, and includes a number of functions to plot and analyse this network. 

A tutorial of how to use this package can be found [here](https://matthewsmith430.github.io/CompaniesHouse/index.html)

## GVTr

This package allows to extract and analyse world input out data, extracting Global Value Trees as outlined by:

Zhu Z, Puliga M, Cerina F, Chessa A, Riccaboni M (2015) Global Value Trees. PLoS ONE 10(5): e0126699. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126699>

The package contain the wiod data for 2000 -2014, allows to create value added networks from this data, prune into global value trees and visualise these GVTs. 

Further details on the package can be found [here](https://matthewsmith430.github.io/GVTr)
