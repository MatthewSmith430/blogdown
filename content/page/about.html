<p>My name is Matthew Smith and I am currently a lecturer at the University of Greenwich in International Business (IB). I am part of the Centre for Business Network Analysis (CBNA) research centre. <img src="/page/about_files/PROFILE2.jpg" /></p>
<p>My research interests focus on social network analysis, more specifically, the application of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to explain how observed network structures emerge and multilevel network analysis.</p>
<p>I am also interested in the analysis of economic networks, more specifically, the international trade network. Additional interests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Analysis of Input – Output Tables</li>
<li>Application of longitudinal network models to the international trade network</li>
<li>Network Analysis of International Trade Networks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Research Areas</h2>
<p>I recently completed a postdoc at the University of Oxford in the Anthropology department. I was part of a project that aimed at testing hypotheses derived from theoretical models of cultural evolution to shed light on how individual factors and cultural transmission networks shape cultural change. <img src="/page/about_files/OxAnthro1.jpg" /></p>

<h2>PhD Thesis</h2>
<p>I completed my PhD in international business and economics at the University of Greenwich in 2016, where I made use of advanced social network analysis techniques to inform on features of the global economy.</p>
<p>My thesis consisted of three papers/essays addressing the globalisation of industries in recent decades, with a focus on the fragmentation of production.</p>
<p>The first provides the case for a network approach to analyse various aspects of the global economy, more specifically:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>International Trade</li>
<li>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</li>
<li>Multinational Enterprise (MNE) Activity</li>
<li>Fragmentation of Production</li>
<li>Globalisation Vs Regionalisation Debate</li>
</ol>
<p>The second paper presented a multilevel network analysis to examine trade and investment patterns in a high tech sector. See presentation page for conference slides on this paper.</p>
<p>The third paper provided an analysis of the interplay between the international trade network and national competitiveness in the automotive sector. More specifically examining how a nation’s position in an international network of trade and efficient linkages to competitive nations impacts a nation’s competitive performance.</p>
