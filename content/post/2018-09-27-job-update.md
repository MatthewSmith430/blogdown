In September 2018, I joined the University of Greenwich as a Lecturer in International Business (IB), after completing my postodc at the University of Oxford. I am part of the [Centre for Business network Analysis (CBNA)](https://www.gre.ac.uk/business/research/centres/cbna), where I hope to make a signifcant contribution to the centre and continue my research on the application of social network analysis to economic areas.
