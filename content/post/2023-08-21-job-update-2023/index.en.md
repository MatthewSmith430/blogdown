At the start of August, I joined [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), as an Associate Professor in Social Research Methods. I will be part of the [Doctoral Centre](https://www.hw.ac.uk/ebs/about/subject/research-methods.htm) in the School of Social Sciences, and will join the [Centre for Networks and Enterprise Excellence](https://www.hw.ac.uk/ebs/research/networks-enterprise-excellence.htm).
