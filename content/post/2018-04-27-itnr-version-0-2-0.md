# International Trade Network (ITN) Analysis in R
A new version of my package ITNr (0.2.0) is now on [CRAN!](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ITNr/index.html) 

The ITNr package presents a set of functions of to clean trade data, implement desciptitve analysis of the ITN and create a range of plots.

I have updated and corrected the documentation for function is the last version, and have added several new functions. These include:  

* core_periphery_weighted: To identify whether nodes belong to the core/periphery in weighted directed/undirected networks. Using the approach aproach developed by [Ma & Mondrag√≥n (2015)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119678)

* ITN_map_plot: Creates a plot where the ITN is layered onto a map
