Recently, I was attempting to layer plots created using `ggplot` onto a map. I came across this example, and it was exactly what I wanted. It produced this plot using a package called `ggsubplot`

![](/post/2019-10-01-ggplot-maps.en_files/A3Fae.png)

However, after trying to install and use `ggsubplot` I found out that it has been deprecated for some time (now incompatable with current versions of `ggplot2`) and has been since removed from CRAN, as detailed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16028659/plotting-bar-charts-on-map-using-ggplot2).

Therefore, I found an alternative approach to layer plots made using `ggplot` onto a map - by employing the `googleway` package. This takes extra steps - but allows you to add ggplots to googlemaps. 

To demonstrate this I will use example data from Yelp - plotting barbers in Manchester, first using markers, then plotting graph showing price and rating information.

# Extracting example data
I have used Yelp data for this example, as it is ideal as it has geographic information, along with additional data to create a plot for each location. 
This was extracted pro grammatically in R using the Yelp API. 

In order to use the Yelp API, you need to create an app [through their development area.](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app) This allows you to create a client id and api key which you can use to extract data. 

I create the following function, which relies on the `httr` and `jsonlite` packages to extract the data, along with the `tidyverse` to clean it. It requires 6 inputs:  

* term - what are you searching for  

* location - the area where you want to search  

* limit - how many results do you want to find  

* radius -  radius of the location

* client_id - client id key from Yelp  

* api - api key from Yelp  

```{r yelp_function, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse) 

yelp_search<-function(term,location,limit, radius,client_id,api){
  yelp <- "https://api.yelp.com"

  url <- modify_url(yelp, path = c("v3", "businesses", "search"),
                    query = list(term = term, location = location, 
                                 limit = limit,
                                 radius = radius))
  res <- GET(url, add_headers('Authorization' = paste("bearer", api)))
  
  resTEXT<-httr::content(res, as="text")
  JLres<-jsonlite::fromJSON(resTEXT, flatten=TRUE)
  
  BUS<-JLres$businesses
  cat_list<-list()
  for (i in 1:length(BUS$name)){
    categories1<-BUS$categories[[i]] %>%
      as.vector()
    c2<-as.vector(categories1$title)
    c3<-paste0(c2, collapse = ", ")
    cat_list[[i]]<-c3
    }
    
  c4<-unlist(cat_list)
  

  BUSINESS_DF<-select(BUS,name,rating,review_count,price,phone,
                      latitude=coordinates.latitude,
                      longitude=coordinates.longitude,
                      postcode=location.zip_code)%>%
    mutate(categories=c4)%>%
    as_tibble()
  
  BUSINESS_DF$price_num<-nchar(BUSINESS_DF$price)
  
  return(BUSINESS_DF)
  
  }

```

In this example we are extracting data for barber shops in Manchester, UK. I filter, only examining the data where there is price information. 

```{r yelp_ex1, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
term <- "barber"
location <- "Manchester, UK"
limit <- 20
radius <- 8000
#api and client_id are obtained from Yelp developer page

yelp_df <- yelp_search(term,location,limit,radius,client_id,api)%>%
  filter(!is.na(price_num))
```

```{r yelp_ex2, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

yelp_df <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "yelp_df.csv"))

library(kableExtra)

yelp_df %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                position = "center")
```


# Map with markers 
the first thing that you can do with `googleway` is to map the data on google maps with markers. 

You can include additional information that will appear when you click on the marker. To do this we add an extra column to the dataframe with the info that will appear when you click on the marker. In this case it is the name and rating.

```{r data_adj, eval=FALSE}
yelp_df$info<-paste0("<b>Name: </b>",yelp_df$name," ",
                "<b>Rating: </b>",yelp_df$rating)

```

We then plot this data with `googleway`. However, before using `googleway` you need to register with google maps and obtain an api key, details on how to do this are provided [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) 

In this example we refer to the google map api as `key`. 

```{r map1,eval=FALSE}
library(googleway)
library(tidyverse)

set_key(key = key) #key is the api

google_map() %>%
  add_markers(
    data = yelp_df,
    info_window = "info"
  )
```


```{r map1_run,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,width = 5, height = 5}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

yelp_df <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "yelp_df.csv"))
yelp_df$info<-paste0("<b>Name: </b>",yelp_df$name," ",
                "<b>Rating: </b>",yelp_df$rating)
library(googleway)
key<-"AIzaSyD2Z4xmMtAqqwF8bK1CsyZZI0niuM_iKQg"
set_key(key = key) #key is the api

l<-google_map() %>%
  add_markers(
    data = yelp_df,
    info_window = "info"
  )

library(widgetframe)

frameWidget(l,height = '400')

```
  

You can also alter the colours of the markers, instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53836446/r-googleway-change-marker-colors)

# Map with plots 
To replace the markers with plots, there are a number of steps we have to take:  

* Create the plots with `ggplot`  
* Save plots to a file and create a link for the file  
* Re-plot with `googleway`  

## Create the plots
We create the plots with `ggplot` In this example, I am plotting a bar plot for each firm, with firm rating, number of reviews and price. 
The theme is altered to remove text from the plot, and to make the background transparent. 

In `ggsave` the width and height is the size of the plot/file. You might want to adjust to find the most suitable size. 

```{r plot_example,eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
for(i in 1:length(yelp_df$name)) {
  name_place<-yelp_df$name[[i]]
  yp<-select(yelp_df,name,rating,review_count,price_num)%>%
    melt()
  p <- ggplot(subset(yp, name==name_place), 
              aes(variable, value,  fill = variable)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", show.legend=FALSE)+
    theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
          axis.text.x=element_blank(),
          axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
          axis.title.y=element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), # bg of the panel
          plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA), # bg of the plot
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # get rid of major grid
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # get rid of minor grid
          legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"), # get rid of legend bg
          legend.box.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent") # get rid of legend panel bg
)
  file_name<-paste0("figure_",i,"_",name_place,".png")%>%
    tolower()%>%
    gsub("[[:space:]]", "", .)
  
  ggsave(file_name, p,width=0.6,height=0.3,
           bg = "transparent")
}

```


I then create a link to the images. To do this I have created a GitHub repository, where I have saved the images. This allows me to use the following link structure. 

```{r image_link, eval=FALSE}
path_to_images <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewsmith430/vis_image/master/"

for (i in 1:length(yelp_df$name)){
  name_place<-yelp_df$name[[i]]
  
  
  file_name<-paste0("figure_",i,"_",name_place,".png")%>%
    tolower()%>%
    gsub("[[:space:]]", "", .)
  
  yelp_df$image[i]<-paste0(path_to_images, file_name)
  
}
```

## Add plots to the map
```{r final_map,eval=FALSE}
library(googleway)
library(tidyverse)

set_key(key = key) #key is the api

google_map() %>%
  add_markers(
    data = yelp_df,
    marker_icon = "image",
    info_window = "info"
  )

```

The plots show the number of reviews, price and rating. The colours are:  

* Green = Review Count  

* Red = Rating  

* Blue = Price  

```{r map2_run,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}


library(tidyverse)
library(here)

yelp_df <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "yelp_df.csv"))
yelp_df$info<-paste0("<b>Name: </b>",yelp_df$name," ",
                "<b>Rating: </b>",yelp_df$rating)

path_to_images <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewsmith430/vis_image/master/"

for (i in 1:length(yelp_df$name)){
  name_place<-yelp_df$name[[i]]
  
  
  file_name<-paste0("figure_",i,"_",name_place,".png")%>%
    tolower()%>%
    gsub("[[:space:]]", "", .)
  
  yelp_df$image[i]<-paste0(path_to_images, file_name)
  
}

library(googleway)
key<-"AIzaSyD2Z4xmMtAqqwF8bK1CsyZZI0niuM_iKQg"
set_key(key = key) #key is the api

gm<-google_map() %>%
  add_markers(
    data = yelp_df,
    marker_icon = "image",
    info_window = "info"
  )
library(widgetframe)

frameWidget(gm,height = '400')

```
