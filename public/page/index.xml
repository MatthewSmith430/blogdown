      <description>My name is Matthew Smith and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the Anthropology department. I am working on a project that aims at testing hypotheses derived from theoretical models of cultural evolution to shed light on how individual factors and cultural transmission networks shape cultural change.
My research interests focus on social network analysis, more specifically, the application of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to explain how observed network structures emerge and multilevel network analysis.</description>
