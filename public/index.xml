      <description>International Trade Network (ITN) Analysis in RA new version of my package ITNr (0.2.0) is now on CRAN!
The ITNr package presents a set of functions of to clean trade data, implement desciptitve analysis of the ITN and create a range of plots.
I have updated and corrected the documentation for function is the last version, and have added several new functions. These include:
core_periphery_weighted: To identify whether nodes belong to the core/periphery in weighted directed/undirected networks.</description>

      <description>As this my very first blog post for this site (created using blogdown) I decided to write some comments/general points on my experience moving from a being a general R user making use of functions to writing R packages, using GitHub, and making use of markdown and blogdown.
PackagesThroughout my PhD I had to create networks from international trade data. This involved cleaning the data, removing unnecessary actors (such as territories like “Other Asia not elsewhere classified”), applying a threshold, so the network only contained ties that were some percentage of world trade and finally convert this into a network file.</description>

      <description>My name is Matthew Smith and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the Anthropology department. I am working on a project that aims at testing hypotheses derived from theoretical models of cultural evolution to shed light on how individual factors and cultural transmission networks shape cultural change.
My research interests focus on social network analysis, more specifically, the application of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to explain how observed network structures emerge and multilevel network analysis.</description>

      <description>I have authored a number of R packages, that can all be found on my GitHub page
The key packages are:
 ITNr
 CompaniesHouse
 GVTr
  ITNr This package provides a set of function to clean and process international trade data into a network.
It also provides tools to implement various descriptive analysis and plots of the international trade network.
