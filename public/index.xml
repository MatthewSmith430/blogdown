      <description>As this my very blog post for this site (created using blogdown) I decided to write some comments/general points on my experience moving from a being a general R user making use of functions to writing R packages, using GitHub, and making use of markdown and blogdown.
Packages Throughout my PhD I had to create network from international trade data. This involved cleaning the data, removing unnecessary actors (such as territories like “Other Asia not elsewhere classified”), and applying a threshold, so the network only contained ties that were some percentage of world trade and finally convert this into a network file.</description>

      <description>My name is Matthew Smith and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the Anthropology department. I am working on a project that aims at testing hypotheses derived from theoretical models of cultural evolution to shed light on how individual factors and cultural transmission networks shape cultural change.
My research interests focus on social network analysis, more specifically, the application of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to explain how observed network structures emerge and multilevel network analysis.</description>
